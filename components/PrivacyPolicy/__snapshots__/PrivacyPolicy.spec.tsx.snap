    <li>
      For any other purpose to which you consent.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you the opportunity to limit the sharing of “non-experience information” among our affiliates. “Non-experience information” includes information that is used, expected to be used, or collected for the purpose of establishing your eligibility for consumer credit, insurance or deposit accounts, and is not related solely to your transactions or other experiences with us, including information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      From your applications, such as your income or marital status;
    </li>
    <li>
      From a credit report, such as your credit history; and
    </li>
    <li>
      From sources used to verify representations made by you, such as your open lines of credit; or employment history.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Within our company or approved affiliates of the Company, we may share customer information we collect on the Website, providing financial and other services such as:

  <h2>
    How We Share Personal Information
  </h2>
  <p>
    We will only share personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. Such shared personal information with third parties includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Agents or service providers acting on our behalf for limited purposes;
    </li>
    <li>
      As required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, court order or similar legal process);
    </li>
    <li>
      Vendors who provide employment and income verification or other verification services, banking information, document import, and other necessary services;
    </li>
    <li>
      Company-affiliated businesses that provide quality services or products you may be interested in;
    </li>
    <li>
      For any purpose to which you expressly consent; and/or
    </li>
    <li>
      Other third parties if necessary to protect our rights or the rights or safety of others;
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We limit the information that we send to service providers, and require that our service providers only use shared personal information to perform the services requested in accordance with this Privacy Policy and have adequate security measures in place to protect any of your shared personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, after you authorize us to verify your credit history, we send the minimal amount of information needed (including your social security number) to ensure we are requesting the correct record in an encrypted form to the relevant credit bureaus with the sole purpose of retrieving your credit report and associated credit history data. We would not send the same level of information to a service provider where it is not essential to perform their services.
  </p>
  <p>
    For retrieving certain information such as bank information (transactions, balances, accounts, and other information), we use third-party service providers. In the event that we enter into a corporate transaction, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), personal information that we have collected may be transferred in the course of that corporate transaction to the relevant third party purchaser, joint venture partner, merged entity, assignee or similar party.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Third Parties
  </h2>
  <p>
    Other than for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information or general information to third parties without informing you in advance.
  </p>
  <p>
    We provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties (collectively, “service partners”). Our service partners may use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver their services.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, your data may be transferred to website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in designing and operating the Website, executing services or helping us analyze collected data. These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work as agreed with us and will be required to keep the information confidential. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to our control.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will release personal or general information without your consent for security purposes, when required by law, or to prevent imminent harm to any person or entity. We will disclose personal or general information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, which may include responding to requests and court orders from jurisdictions outside the United States. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. Release of your personal data for security purposes, as described in this agreement to any person or entity under any circumstances shall be based on a determination made solely by us, exercising our own discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you to us in accordance with this policy.
  </p>

    Tracking

We do not control those third-party sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from our practices. Company is not liable for the content and activities of those sites. This includes links from partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement. Your visits and access to such websites is at your own risk.

  <h2>
    Use of Social Media Tools
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Website allows you to use your social media accounts to pre-populate certain fields. If you choose to use this feature, you are allowing us to access your personal information.
